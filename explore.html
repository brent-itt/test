                        <p>The first time I heard "Let Down," I almost couldn't believe it was a Radiohead song. The emotions it evoked seemed too optimistic; for a Radiohead song, it felt weirdly comforting. Although there is a sense of melancholy and subdued rage in the lyrics, to me, the music ultimately conveys a feeling of acceptance. Lyrically and musically, "Let Down" remains one of my favorite Radiohead songs.</p>
